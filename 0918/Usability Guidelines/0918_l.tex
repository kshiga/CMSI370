\section*{Introduction}
\paragraph*{Interaction Design}~\\

In the second chapter of their text \emph{Designing the User Interface}, Shneiderman and Plaisant discuss "\emph{standards}" to follow while creating systems.  The chapter separates these rules into Guidelines, specific definitions distributed and adhered to by companies and organizations and Principles, broader generalizations that are more "fundamental."  \\

For this report, personalization tasks on the Mac, Windows, and Linux systems were pitted against each other to test their usability.  Each provides a basic philosophy or guidelines for developers to follow.  Further discussion of the guidelines can be found in the \textit{/guideline survey/} section of the repository.  
\paragraph*{Usability Metrics} ~\\

In order to create a concrete, non-subjective method of rating the usability of systems, a set of 5 usability metrics were created.  These assign qualitative values in order to rate systems numerically. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Learnability}: the amount of time that it takes to learn the system.  
\item \textbf{Memorability}: the amount of time that it takes to recall how to use a system after a period of time has passed since learning.  
\item \textbf{Efficiency}: the amount of time it takes to complete a task using the system.
\item \textbf{Errors}: the amount of errors made while completing a task while using the system.
\item \textbf{Satisfaction}: the amount of satisfaction gained while using the system. 
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph*{Usability Meterics in context of this assignment}~\\
We are comparing the interaction designs of Mac, Windows and Linux operating systems.  Our focus will be the desktop.  We will be timing how long it takes to change the desktop background, change the screen resolution, and take a screen shot.  We will be looking at three of the four usability metrics: Learnability, Efficiency, and Satisfaction.  \\
~\\
Learnability is how fast a person who knows nothing about a system can accomplish something with that system.  How fast can the user figure out how to get to the change desktop menu?  How easy is it for the user to figure out how to change the screen resolution?  How fast can the user learn how to take a screen shot?  We are comparing how well each operating system helps the user learn how to accomplish the three tasks.  We will be asking some users to complete the tasks on systems they are not familiar with.\\

~\\
Efficiency is how fast a person who knows how to use a system well can accomplish a certain task.  Which system allows the user to change the desktop background, change the screen resolution and take a screen shot the fasted?  We will compare how fast each operating system allows the user to complete the tasks.  We will be timing users who are skilled with each system.\\
~\\
Satisfaction is how happy a user is with a system.  We are recording each personâ€™s opinion after completing each task in order to see which operating system is the most pleasing for the user.  How pleased was the user with the process of changing the background, changing the screen resolution and taking a screen shot?\\

\section*{Procedure}

\paragraph*{3 Concrete Tests} ~\\
In order to test system usability, the following three tests were concieved:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Saving a jpg via the Chrome Browser to the computer and setting it as the background
\item Changing the Screen Resolution
\item Taking a screenshot.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph*{Procedure} ~\\
For each subject, we prepared, on a Linux, Windows, and Mac, the Chrome Browser with a picture that had never been saved to the computer before and closed all superflous windows. The system settings icon remained in the taskbar of every system.  The subjects were briefed on the tests as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Background Changing}: You must save this (indicates) picture and set it as your desktop background.  Feel free to open any window or use any sort of help dialouge or search engine.
\item \textbf{Screen Resolution Change}: Alter the screen resolution from the current set-up to any other setting.
\item \textbf{Taking a Screen Shot}: Take a screenshot of the desktop and save it.
\end{enumerate}
We first tested the subject on the foriegn system and then on their usual systems. The times were recorded on a Samsung Galaxy S3 default clock/stopwatch.  Miliseconds were not recorded.  Satisfaction was rated on a scale of 1-10, with 1 being the least satisfaction and 10 being the most satisfaction.

\section*{Data Reports}
Our first subject was a male junior, who works primarily on Apple, has had some Windows experience, and no experience on Linux. His main system was Apple and new system was Linux.
\begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{ | l | l | l |}
    \hline
    Task &Main System & New System  \\ \hline
    Changing Background & 0:07 & 1:16  \\ \hline
    Changing Screen Resolution & 0:09 & 0:39  \\ \hline
    Screen Shot & 1:07 & 0:02 \\
    \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{center}
The subject was very agitated when setting the desktop on the Linux.  He had also forgotten the shortcut on the mac and was trying multiple combinations and opened up music players and browsers in the meanwhile. 
He rated the Linux a 6/10 satisfaction and the Apple an 7/10.

Our second subject was a female junior, who works primarily on Apple, has had some Windows experience, and no experience on Linux.  Her main system was Apple and new system was Linux.
\begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{ | l | l | l |}
    \hline
    Task &Main System & New System  \\ \hline
    Changing Background & 0:04 & 1:12  \\ \hline
    Changing Screen Resolution & 0:16 & 0:45  \\ \hline
    Screen Shot & 0:02 & 0:01 \\
    \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{center}
She rated the Linux a 4.5/10 satisfaction and the Apple an 8.5/10.

Our second subject was a female junior, who works primarily on Apple, has had some Windows experience, and little experience on Linux. Her main system was Apple and new system was Linux.
\begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{ | l | l | l |}
    \hline
    Task &Main System & New System  \\ \hline
    Changing Background & 0:30 & 2:41  \\ \hline
    Changing Screen Resolution & 0:16 & 1:12  \\ \hline
    Screen Shot & 0:03 & 0:01 \\
    \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{center}
She rated the Linux a 6.5/10 satisfaction and the Apple an 7.5/10

\section*{Reflections}
\textit{These reflections reflect those of Lisa Rosenbaum.  The same report, but with Lisa}

For this experiment we had people change the desktop background, change the
screen resolution and take a screen shot. For the people we timed, it took longer
for people with little or no Linux experience to figure out how to set the desktop
background on a Linux computer then it did for people to figure out how to set
the desktop background for a Mac. It also took longer for people who did have
Linux experience to set the desktop background on a Linux computer then it did
for people who have experience with a Mac to set the desktop picture on a Mac. It
seemed to be equally easy to change the screen resolution on both Mac and Linux.
People took around the same amounts of time. It was much easier for people to
figure out how to take a screen shot on the Linux computer because there was a
screen shot button on the keyboard where as for a Mac people had to figure out or
remember the keyboard short cut(command+shift+4+spacebar). Both people who
where familiar with and unfamiliar with each operating system took screen shots
faster on Linux. Generally the satisfaction level was rated higher for a Mac. Mac
seems to be better with learnability. It is easier for the user to figure out how to
do his/her tasks on a Mac. A Linux computer can be more efficient but if the user
is not familiar with Linux it can be confusing. Learnability played a big role in the
satisfaction ratings. The satisfaction points that were docked from Linux were
mainly because it was hard to figure how to do certain aspects of the tasks.
